    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2>Activity 1 </h2>
    <p>IoT applications are a combination of real-time services that integrate data from numerous connected devices and sensors in addition to using the cloud, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to make well-informed decisions.
       Necessary features for IoT Applications are that it should be real-time, stable, secure. 
       Smooth connection and interaction of devices is also the most important feature. Agricultural drones, Fitness trackers(installed in smart watch), Automatic control of home appliances are few examples Iot Applications. 
    </p>
    <h2>Activity 2</h2>
    <p>A building which is "smart" and is termed as a smart building. 
       When can a building be considered "smart"?
       A smart building have fully secure and trusthworthy technology based facilties and features that benifit the society along with environment.
       Smart automated parking systems, Automated Smart Doors, Smart Ventilation and temperation Management, Accessibility for the disabled are some of the most efficient scenarios of a "smart" building.
       Carbon Monoxide monitoring system, detecting occupany inside the building that are secure and maintained regularly are some added features to a smart building. 
      </p>
    <h2>Activity 3</h2>
    <p>Contol interface is a user friendly, safe and secure interconnected two way communication information systems which manages errors and faults. 
    Occupancy sensors and light sensors such as PIR Motion Sensor(Proximity sensor), IR sensor, Photodiodes, Photovoltaic are some of the parts needed.
    Building management, security control staff, and the public are the users of the control interface.
